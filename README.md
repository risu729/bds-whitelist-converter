# bds-whitelist-converter

A simple program to convert the `whitelist.json` or `allowlist.json` file of an SMP on BDS to the `permissions.json` file for a creative server on BDS. <br>
The generated `permissions.json` file gives an `operator` permission to all players in the whitelist.

*SMP: Server MultiPlayer <br>
*BDS: Bedrock Dedicated Server
